```If you find use in this, it would be great if you would credit me, or if you want to support me even more, donate using the link above. These tools take a ton of time to make and I could easily keep them to myself or charge for them.```

This is a tool that allows you to edit Call of Duty: Black Ops III's LVI Files, these files dictate bloom and some colour settings.

# Using SunSh1n3

```You can load LVI files provided to us by Treyarch and edit them instead of starting from scratch.```

```To quickly reload your LVI file in Radiant, you can untick and tick the USE_BLOOM and USE_COLOR boxes in the PBG entity.```

Using SunSh1n3 is quite simple but the values may be confusing. To begin, simply open the exe, and begin editing values to what you desire. Once done, you can save your LVI file to Black Ops III's `grades` folder and view the result in Radiant.

In the future more documentation on the values may be provided here once they are fully figured out.
